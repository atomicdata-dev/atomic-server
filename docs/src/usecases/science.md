# Scientific publications powered by Atomic Data

- Share and use concepts as URLs, which means they are always explicitly defined.
- Attribution is improved
- Reason about causal relationships that cross article boundaries, explore correlation graphs to gain new insights

## Challenges and opportunities

- Scientific publications are a slow moving field
- Publications tend to favor PDF, which is hard to make machine readable
- Extending a syntax like LaTeX might provide a short path to referring to atomic data in publications
- Getting scientists to host the atomic data is going to be one of the most difficult aspect
