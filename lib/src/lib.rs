/*!
`atomic_lib` helps you to get, store, serialize, parse and validate Atomic Data.
It's primarily used for powering [Atomic-Server](https://github.com/atomicdata-dev/atomic-data-rust).
Many of the features are optional, which helps us keep the default size small.

See the [Atomic Data Docs](https://docs.atomicdata.dev) for more information.

## Features

- Two stores for Atomic Data:
  - **On disk** [Db], powered by Sled. Indexes filtered queries. (requires `db` feature)
  - **In-memory** [Store] for getting / setting data. Useful for client applications.
- [parse] and import tools for [JSON-AD](https://docs.atomicdata.dev/core/json-ad.html)
- [serialize] tools for JSON-AD, plain JSON, RDF, Turtle, N-Triples and JSON-LD.
- [Resource] with getters, setters and a `.save` function that creates Commits.
- [Value] converts Atomic Data to Rust native types
- [Commit]s (transactions / delta's / changes / updates / versioning / history). Supports many checks, such as Schema, Authorization and more.
- [collections] (pagination, sorting, filtering)
- Queries (see [storelike::Query])
- [hierarchy] for authorization
- [crate::endpoints::Endpoint] for custom API endpoints
- [config::Config] files. (requires `config` feature)
- [endpoints] which allow easily adding routes with custom features
- [plugins] system basics. Not very mature, as we still need the code in this repo. (all plugins require `db` feature)
- [plugins::invite] for sharing URLs that grant rights
- [plugins::chatroom] for slack-like group chats.
- [plugins::bookmark] for fetching HTML pages, converting them to markdown, and storing them as Atomic Data (requires `html` feature)
- [plugins::versioning] for constructing previous versions of resources, powered by [Commit]s.

## Getting started

```
// Import the `Storelike` trait to get access to most functions
use atomic_lib::Storelike;
// Start with initializing the in-memory store
let store = atomic_lib::Store::init().unwrap();
// Pre-load the default Atomic Data Atoms (from atomicdata.dev),
// this is not necessary, but will probably make your project a bit faster
store.populate().unwrap();
// We can create a new Resource, linked to the store.
// Note that since this store only exists in memory, it's data cannot be accessed from the internet.
// Let's make a new Property instance! Let's create "age".
let mut new_property = atomic_lib::Resource::new_instance("https://atomicdata.dev/classes/Property", &store).unwrap();
// And add a description for that Property
new_property.set_shortname("description", "the age of a person", &store).unwrap();
// A subject URL for the new resource has been created automatically.
let subject = new_property.get_subject().clone();
// Now we need to make sure these changes are also applied to the store.
// In order to change things in the store, we should use Commits,
// which are signed pieces of data that contain state changes.
// Because these are signed, we need an Agent, which has a private key to sign Commits.
let agent = store.create_agent(Some("my_agent")).unwrap();
store.set_default_agent(agent);
let _fails   = new_property.save_locally(&store);
// But.. when we commit, we get an error!
// Because we haven't set all the properties required for the Property class.
// We still need to set `shortname` and `datatype`.
new_property.set_shortname("shortname", "age", &store).unwrap()
  .set_shortname("datatype", atomic_lib::urls::INTEGER, &store).unwrap()
  .save_locally(&store).unwrap();
// Now the changes to the resource applied to the store, and we can fetch the newly created resource!
let fetched_new_resource = store.get_resource(&subject).unwrap();
assert!(fetched_new_resource.get_shortname("description", &store).unwrap().to_string() == "the age of a person");
```
